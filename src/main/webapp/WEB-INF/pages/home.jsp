<div class="hero-unit">
<p>Welcome to the flight application. Search Flights and book
	reservations. All reservations require a name and a quantity which
	serve to demonstrate JSR 303 validation.</p>
<p>Spring Security is enabled on the flight application. An embedded
	LDAP server is used for demonstration. Database or any other
	authentication source can be used as well. This application provides
	Cookie based handling of the user session and stays away from the HTTP
	Session. The following are the three roles defined:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>User: Can view Airports, search flights and view all
		reservations (yeah I know)</li>
	<li>Agent: An agent can do all that a user can with the additional
		ability to create reservations</li>
	<li>Admin: An admin can do all the things a user can but cannot
		reserve flights. However they are the only group that can add new
		airports to the system.</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are 3 users defined for each type of role:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Sanjay User - Login/Pass:suser/pass</li>
	<li>Sanjay Agent - Login/Pass:sagent/pass</li>
	<li>Sanjay Admin - Login/Pass:sadmin/pass</li>
</ul>
<p>
Login as each of them to see the controls available.
